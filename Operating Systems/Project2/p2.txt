The following program is for David Hughes (n00814425) written 
10/30/15 and submitted to Rogger Eggen Operating System class. 
The following code uses pipes that messages are sent between process
 1 and the store manager and process 2 and the store manager. 
The store manager reads the messages and writes it to a log file 
of all the transactions that have been done. Meanwhile a display is 
up at the terminal that a user can poke at both stores and get 
updates on what they have done by pressing 1 for process 1 or 2 for
 process 2. The file must be executed with 4 arguments in order of 
INIT.DAT LOG.DAT TRANS1 TRANS2. The code is split up from the main
 where the store manager header handles all of the store manager 
processes while the transactions process header handles the processes.
The lib.h file has many erroneous functions that help prevent errors
 the enum patch and other functions that helped diagnose or read and 
write to the tables. The Transaction process takes place of both stores
because they both do the same functions. Otherwise tried to use 1 signal to interupt each one.
