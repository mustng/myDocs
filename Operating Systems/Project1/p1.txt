The following program is for David Hughes (n00814425) written 10/05/15 and submitted to Rogger Eggen Operating System class. The following project 1 make the use of forking and then uses Semaphores to control the variable one at a time. The Semaphores are control using my n number which is written above backwards. The successful execution leaves the program exiting and cleaning out shared memory, processes that are produced by forking, and last the semaphore upon exit an termination of the program. The program was written in C++ and makes use of the enum to declare the states of the semaphore meaning Access, Full, or Empty.  In the print process I added it printing the head and tail of the shared memory for better tracking of the execution.
