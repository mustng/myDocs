The following program project 4 was written for Dr. Eggen's Compiler class in April 2016. It does the math operations from left to right in order of signs:
highest
 |       (  )
 |       [ ] to assign a temporary
 |       / * left to right index
 |       + - left to right index
 |     <  <=  > >=
 |      ==  !=
 v
lowest

The first temporary starts at 1 instead of 0 like some test files. The code is split up in the p3.java and run by mainly 3 functions. The first handles “functions” and “decorations” then anything in parenthesis and or math operators are broken down to a stringToCalc and sent to the other function to deal with the rest. The last functions is just deals with repetitive lines of code and called calcSomeMoreToSaveLineOfCode. Last the phrases I used goes as follows beside the obvious add/sub.
comp		<, <=, >, >=
ISEQ		==
NOTEQ 		!=
	and
BRG		>
BRL		<
BRGEQ 		>=
BRLEQ		<=
BREEQ		==
BRNEQ		!=
