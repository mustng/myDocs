The following program was written for Dr. Eggen compiler class on Feb 2016. The projects inherits the code from the first project which looks at everything and checks to see if it in an ID, symbol, or keyword and actually tokenizes it all into a queue. On the other end I created a stack which starts with a "$", "A" pushed on to it. The parser created then loads in a table into a hash table to then add or pop from the stack depending on the grammer or if there are matching terminals that were tokenized.. If everything is valid it prints the statement ACCEPT or if bad prints REJECT on to the screen. I have including the table in png format for more of a user readable format and lookup.txt contains the formatted table that is brought in.
