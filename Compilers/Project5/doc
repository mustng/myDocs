The following program project 5 was written for Dr. Eggen's Compiler class in April 2016. The first .l file is written for lex/flex to outline what the tokens should look like and is canceled out and shut down by the “\n” new line character by the end of the input or test file and creates tokens. The grammar portion of my file or .y file is built for bison syntax and how the makefile compiles the final output. The grammar was supplied for the project and replicated with the worlds famous grammar .y file. The final output is ACCEPT or REJECT based on if the input is valid SQL or not. The project is executed by ./p5 <filename or ./p5 enter and give it an input to test. In testfile 1 should accept and testfile 2 should reject. Supplied to meet requirments of the project outline.
