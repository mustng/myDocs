The following program was written for Dr. Eggen's Compiler class in April 2016. It uses the code from project 1 and project 2 to check the code that is given and makes sure that it is valid for project 3. In project 3 it looks over the code and checks many different scenarios.  The project mainly works with scope and when variables are declared to print ACCEPT or REJECT based on the input. The meat of the project is in an analysis function where it takes in every value that was also “tokenized” and it evaluates it. To start off, the main goal is when int, float, or void are called, it looks after it to see if there is a ( or a ; to tell if its a function call or not. Otherwise, everything is done in an Array-list and in the Array-list called scope it will build and remove items based on the input.  The following rules are how I programmed project 3. There may only be one main. If a function is called before it was created then it will fail. Check every function then if it is void or int than it needs to either return a value or not. Check every variable that it is actually declared in the scope and that it is a float or and int. I take in numbers as # if they are an int and % if they are a float because the data itself is invalid. Test function parameters to make sure they are valid. Main can only have void parameter and be declared void. Among many other checks I make sure there are no duplicates.
