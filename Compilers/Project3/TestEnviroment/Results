#	The following document was created by a script written by Travis King and edited
#by David Hughes for Professor Egen project 3. Tests 1 through 24 are from one 
#source and 25 through 39 another. Good Luck
#	This script is made for personal use and is free to use for anyone else
#However no assurance is given that this test is accurate. If one excecutes this script
#and passess all tests as defined by the user of this script this does not assure that
#a passing grade on the project itself.
