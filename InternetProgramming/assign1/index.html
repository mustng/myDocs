<TITLE>COP 4813 : Internet Programming</TITLE>

<img class = "pic" src="img1.jpg" alt="Me" width="200" height="200">

<p>My name is <font color="darkgreen"><b>David Hughes</b></font> and my whole life I have grown up with a computer and 
have always loved the technology and advances they provide. The knowledge base is so 
huge, it's a never ending process and I hope to get a career in the field I enjoy. 
I worked with a landlord for a few years and learned how to re-wire and 
re-plumb entire houses. With the skills I acquired, I bought my own rental properties 
that I run and manage. A few years after that, I switched jobs to appliance repair and 
have been repairing appliances ever since. While working, I stayed in college 
consistently throughout the years and hope to graduate at the end of fall 2016 in the 
computer science field with my math minor.</p>

<p>For fun, I like to scuba dive and have I swam many of the Florida springs and I 
have even gone to the Gulf to search for Megalodon shark teeth. In the past year I 
have been taking on my fear of heights and started climbing rock walls, which also 
makes for fun exercise. Lastly, I have been riding motorcycles for the past 9 years 
for fun and it saves a ton of gas for commuting compared to my car.</p>
 
 <p>My most recent project </font>for fun, I made a home security 
 system for my own home and rental property that ties into littleBits cloudBit. 
 Anytime the motion sensors are tripped I get a cell phone call. It is easily 
 integrated with a cell phone app and works great. </p>
