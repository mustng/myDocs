			<P>The following assignment is about learning the basics of HTML and how to use it to 
			build a website. Once created with the basics you can then use what I learned about CSS 
			to "style" the web page and help give it a more professional appeal. Lastly, the provided 
			book on web page design and etiquette helps to properly create web pages without making 
			them sloppy and ugly with proper architecture in place.</P>

			<P>Reflection: This was a very fun assignment because I have always played with 
			professional software like Dreamweaver and would design pages but never actually 
			implemented them. It was better to learn how to do it from scratch so like programming, 
			you could walk up to almost any computer and start creating anything without the help of 
			fancy software and make it just as professional looking.</P>

			<P>The purpose of assignment 2 is to make use of textboxes, radio buttons, check boxes, reset button, and 
			submit button. Each need to be created then you have to write a script that reads the input and then output 
			a message depending on the results. All this is done while error checking to make sure input has been 
			received. When this is done I need to create a flowchart that follows our immediate code that was written 
			and display each aspect in the correct box accordingly.</P>
			
			<P>Reflection: I enjoy doing JavaScript because it is so close to Java, aside from its own little quirks. 
			Hopefully it grows to be way more powerful in the future. I found a mode function when I was programming 
			this project and was debating on using it but the issue was it didn't handle multimode. I was debating on 
			having it pull the mode then erase and pull again but since the sync session, we were instructed to try it 
			on our own with our own algorithm I sat down and I was able to pull multiple modes. Lastly, it was neat to 
			be going over Standard Deviation again since I previously learned it in statistics class.</P>

		<P>The purpose of assignment 3 read all about regular expressions. How to use them in JavaScript
		and how it could be useful if we used it in out programming. Following that finish reading everything 
		in the w3schools and tizag. The final process is to you program an assignment that one can input numbers
		into a text box and the user is able to calculate the Sum, Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, and Standard 
		Deviation. The mode needs to be multimode as there can be multiple results and not just one.</P>

		<P>The purpose of assignment 4 is to read html5canvastutorials tutorials. After running though and learning 
		how it works we are to create an animation using HTML5 canvas that does things. There needs to be a few 
		different colors and several shapes when it is designed. Also some text needs to be added with sound effects 
		for extra effects.</P>
			
		<P>Reflection: This was a neat assignment about using shapes to create all sorts of images that can be viewed on 
		web pages. The website "html5canvastutorials" was not really that informative like w3schools was and it had a 
		bunch of scripts running in the background that I had to block to get it to perform well. I looked around for 
		better tutorials but there aren't any. The website just shows an example and lists the functions involved but 
		doesn't go into detail. After reading the tutorial I found a Pac-Man tutorial and thought it would be fun to 
		integrate it into my project plus be able to use this project on the group website by slightly modifying it. 
		The sound was fun to add in and I was surprised how easy it was. There are full HTML5 games out and I can see 
		why people would create them for performance. </P>

		<H3><a href="assign5/login.php" target="_top">Assignment 5</a></H3>

		<P>The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use PHP from the ground up by 
		use of file writing, reading, and appending. Part of the assignment is to make use 
		of SESSIONS for security and to share memory of data types between pages as well as 
		using GET. The assignment makes use of user logins and security to help prevent web 
		pages from being hacked.</P>
			
		<P>Reflection: This was a very difficult assignment and I had a bunch of issues. The 
		first issue was getting the security with the name and password to work until the sync 
		session opened up my world on how that worked. The other issue I had was bringing in 
		the yahoo stock and getting them to populate and I didn't realize the data type was 
		just an array. I used a class I found to get it to progress, and the more I get used 
		to PHP I realized what all the symbols meant and how I could have loaded everything 
		easier on one text file instead of many. Lastly, I was attempting to run everything 
		on my local machine to test but had trouble with the SESSION and GET commands and had 
		to just run it on the server to get it to work. There are still some flaws in my math 
		on my stock calculations but it would take a long time to get everything perfect. 
		There is also no error checking on the page as well so let's say if all the stock 
		were to be deleted the page would collapse. Otherwise a really cool project on what 
		I have accomplished!</P>

		<H3><a href="assign6/index.php" target="_top">Assignment 6</a></H3>

		<P>The purpose of Assignment 6 is to familiarize us with PHP and SQL to run queries to manage a database. 
		We are to read from w3schools on PHP, then read tizag on SQL, and on MySQL. After reading we are to create 
		an assignment that will select, insert, delete, and update a table that we have created from scratch. Also 
		create an entity relationship diagram which is outlines below. </P>
			
		<P>Reflection: This was another pretty hard assignment but really cool to implement SQL commands through 
		programming. I had a bunch of issue with the only to find out I had too many in my code so it made 
		everything inside act up. The second I figured it out and I had spent so much time on it I flew through 
		the rest of the assignment. According to tizag on SQL injection I just need to use the 
		mysql_real_escape_string which I throw everything into it and assign it back to itself to prevent attacks. 
		The command looks at what is being added and checks for nefarious attacks and adds escape characters if 
		they look like possibilities to the data to prevent an injection. I did notice that html code messes with 
		the display of the tables still but the database itself is not impacted at all. There are many other 
		things to do like error checking of fields that could have been implemented but as always time is an issue. 
		Overall great assignment!</P>

		<H3><a href="assign7/index.php" target="_top">Assignment 7</a></H3>

		<P>The purpose of assignment 7 is to familiarize us with AJAX. AJAX uses everything we have used so far with JavaScript 
		but ties it together doing kind of a live processing. The main assignment is to read w3schools schools on XML then move 
		on to read about AJAX through the same website plus tizag. After completed we are to create an assignment that makes 
		use of AJAX and the database we created for project 6.  </P>
			
		<P>Reflection: This was also a fun assignment and a great way to end the course work beside the group project. It's great 
		to see how everything we learned has all tied together to help make such an interactive fun web based experience we could 
		create for anyone.  It makes more since now that I have familiarized myself with these tools of how websites like Google 
		can process your search as you are typing it in. Hope to create more AJAX projects and use this technology more in the future. </p>
