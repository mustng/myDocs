Dear Class,
Please see me in person if you have any questions after running the program with a prompt of 35000.
The number of successes and failures should be the same for every single load factor for both lp and qp.
qp uses base 2 not base e.
Also note that all probe lengths should be >=1 and that averages should be computed to 2 decimal places.
The big thing is that the same data is inserted into all tables so that denominators for successes and failures
should always be the same.
Again, if you have any questions please see me in person and we will run your program. On this one it is
very difficult to see the errors using email.
Best regards,
Ken M
