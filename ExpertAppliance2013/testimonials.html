            <br/>
	        <p>They were worth the wait! Diagnosed and repaired my over-the-range microwave in less than an hour. Showed up when they said they would! Friendly, fast service. Highly recommend.</p>
	        <br style="clear:both" />

            <h3>E.S.</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Although their address was a bit tricky to find. The service was great! I came in with ease and they took care of my microwave oven. Fantastic job!</p>

            <p>Great, honest company. Save yourself the trouble and call EARS immediately for your appliance repairs. I cannot recommend highly enough!</p>

            <p>I own a Samsung cook top and my warranty company advised me to call Expert Appliance Repair because of their white glove service. I did and was very impressed. Their office staff was polite and was able to have a tech come out that very next day. I have to say the tech gave me a 3 hours block time frame between 1-3 and was on time. My cook top needed a part and the tech had the part in stock on his truck. I was shocked that they were able to fix my cook top that very same day. I still can’t believe I didn’t have to wait weeks for a part. I’ve had other service companies come out and work on my home appliances but no more. I seriously have their card on my refrigerator and refer friends and family to them all the time. Did I mention the tech put on shoe booties when he entered my home. Expert Appliance Repair does provide white glove service and that is why Samsung had me call them.</p>

            <p>Having an appliance out of service for a protracted period is no fun. However, I must admit that my interactions with Expert Appliance Repair were positive throughout the three-week demise of my fancy Bosch dishwasher.</p>
            <p>Unlike the "other" outfit in my area, every call I placed to Expert over the three-week downtime was answered by a human being. Even better, an identifiable one. They showed up right as scheduled for initial diagnosis visit, charged me reasonable price for labor and parts and ultimately did a fine job repairing my Bosch. The two techs who performed the work showed up with disposable footwear covers and a plastic protector for my hardwood floors. Their work was neat and both techs were clearly familiar with the innards of my dishwasher. I would recommend this outfit to anyone in need of a fair deal on an appliance repair and I'm happy that no one answered my call at the first authorized repair outfit to which Bosch directed me.</p>

            <h3>Review: Appliance Repair Service</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Unclogged freezer drain. Performed recall work on dishwasher (replaced power cord) and replace broken spring on dishwasher.</p>
            <p>Steve and Sean arrived on schedule and did a great job unclogging the freezer drain and repairing the dishwasher. They put down a board to protect the wood floors when the dishwasher needed to be pulled out from under the counter. Work was done efficiently and they provided tips on how to keep the freezer drain from clogging in the future. I would definitely use Expert Appliance again.</p>

            <h3>Review: Appliance Repair Service</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Was having issues with our refrigerator and called our warranty company who scheduled us with Expert. Long story but they had to come out multiple times and every time the techs were super friendly and helpful. They got my fridge fixed and back like new and it was a incredibly pleasant experience.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what kind of issues the person had with the tech not showing up on time but I run an apt. management group and I have been working with this company for over two years now and they are always great.  just keep in mind that they are a service company  they don't cut hair so they can't always give you a perfect window and I also get a returned phone call from this company.  Over all I love this company I have worked with both David's and steve from the company and they are all great they truly are the experts.</p>

            <p>I'm a Realtor and needed my sellers Kenmore Refrigerator / Ice Maker fixed as part of the contract.  They came out the very next morning and got it all fixed at a competitive price.  Thanks!  I will call again for future repairs...</p>
