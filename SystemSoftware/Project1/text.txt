Project hashes a text file and stores it. Also if a collision occurs it will report it. 
If a duplicate key is attempted to be stored it is rejected and reported. 
The hash function used adds the ASCII values of every character in the key and mods it to the location of the hash table.
The other function uses the ASCII values to sort if a string number value or ASCII value between 48 to 57 In the end it
stores all values "hashed" with the duplicates created.
