The program is for David Hughes (n00814425) written 04/20/15 and submitted to
 Roger Eggen System Software class. The following project 4 runs through Sic
 Xe assembly code and translates addresses to each line. Its checks for
 duplicates, makes sure start is on the first line, and checks many LTORG 
issues that may come up. The Sic Xe project code must be in the following 
format for this to work:
Col 1-8    label optional
Col 9      blank
Col 10     + optional
Col 11-17  mnemonic
Col 18     blank
Col 19     #, @, =  ... optional
Col 20-29  (operand) label, register, ',',X optional  ...
Col 30-31  blank
Col 32-80  comments optional (NO PERIOD REQUIRED)
The SicOps file  must also be included and is scanned in at run time to help 
calculate all the addresses. It is hashed into a table of size 300. In
the end as the addresses are created and they are also stored into a separate hash table. I used the exact code from project 3 on this project up until I outline with //////////pass 2. The only modifications done before then is the added PrintWriter which creates a temp file to modify the addresses.Also a array list is added to record the address to help with the op cades in pass2.  Finally pass two creates the object code and adds it with the addr done in project 3 to a "filename".lst file then also creates a "filename".obj to help with future work.
