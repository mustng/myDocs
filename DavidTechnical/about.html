                    <strong><p>My name is David and my whole life I have grown up with a computer and
                    have always loved the technology and advances they provide. The knowledge base is so
                        huge, it's a never ending process and I hope to get a career in the field I enjoy.
                        I worked with a landlord for a few years and learned how to re-wire and
                        re-plumb entire houses. With the skills I acquired, I bought my own rental properties
                        that I run and manage. A few years after that, I switched jobs to appliance repair and
                        have been repairing appliances ever since. While working, I stayed in college
                        consistently throughout the years and hope to graduate at the end of fall 2016 in the
                        computer science field with my math minor.</p> <br>

                        <p>For fun, I like to scuba dive and have I swam many of the Florida springs and I
                            have even gone to the Gulf to search for Megalodon shark teeth. In the past year I
                            have been taking on my fear of heights and started climbing rock walls, which also
                            makes for fun exercise. Lastly, I have been riding motorcycles for the past 9 years
                            for fun and it saves a ton of gas for commuting compared to my car.</p>
